Headline: 
Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Enforce Alien Enemies Act Amid Controversy

Opening Paragraph:
In a significant victory for the Trump administration, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the enforcement of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority used to rapidly deport alleged gang members, while litigation over its use continues in lower courts. This decision comes amid growing scrutiny over the administration's compliance with court orders and potential contempt charges.

Body:

According to the Supreme Court ruling, individuals subject to deportation under the Act should receive notice and have the opportunity for their removal to be reviewed by the federal court where they are detained. Three of the court's liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett partially dissented.

President Donald Trump lauded the decision, declaring it a “great day for justice in America.” Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed this sentiment, calling it a “landmark victory for the rule of law.”

However, the ruling is not without controversy. A second U.S. judge, Paula Xinis of Maryland, accused Trump officials of failing to comply with court requests for information in a deportation case involving Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member wrongfully deported to El Salvador. She described their responses as "vague, evasive, and incomplete," indicating a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.

Adding to the controversy, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has also threatened to hold the Trump administration in contempt due to defiance of court orders. Boasberg warned that officials may be required to testify under oath, and if they fail to comply, the case could be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution.

Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act has resulted in the deportation of over 260 migrants to El Salvador. The administration claims that these individuals, allegedly members of gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, pose a threat to the American people.

The Supreme Court's decision comes amid a flurry of immigration-related legal battles nationwide as Trump pushes forward with his border security priorities. Despite the ongoing litigation, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the administration can continue using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, provided they receive due process protections, including the right to challenge removals in court.

What happens next remains uncertain as the appeals court has temporarily paused Boasberg's contempt proceedings. Trump officials have repeatedly criticized so-called "activist judges," accusing courts of obstructing the administration's immigration agenda.

Closing Paragraph:
As the Trump administration continues its aggressive immigration push, the enforcement of the Alien Enemies Act has raised concerns over the rapid deportations and the potential risks involved. With the Supreme Court's ruling, these deportations are likely to continue, marking a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy. The White House has yet to comment on the possible contempt proceedings or the next steps in the Abrego Garcia case.
